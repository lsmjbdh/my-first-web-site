    Sleep deficiency can cause problems with learning, focusing, and reacting. You may have trouble making decisions, solving problems, remembering things, managing your emotions and behavior, and coping with change. You may take longer to finish tasks, have a slower reaction time, and make more mistakes.
  </p>
  <p>
   <strong> Sleep deficiency can cause you to feel very tired during the day.</strong> You may not feel refreshed and alert when you wake up. <u> Sleep deficiency also can interfere with work, school, driving, and social functioning.</u>
