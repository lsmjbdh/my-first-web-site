<p><strong><u>The deadlift is a weight training exercise in which a loaded barbell or bar is lifted off the ground to the level of the hips, torso perpendicular to the floor, before being placed back on the ground.</u></strong> It is one of the three powerlifting exercises, along with the squat and bench press,[1] as well as a frequent lift in strongman.<br></p>
<p style="margin-top: 400px;">Two styles of deadlift are commonly used in competition settings: the conventional deadlift and the sumo deadlift.[2] While both of these styles are permitted under the rules of powerlifting, only the conventional stance is permitted in strongman.</p>
