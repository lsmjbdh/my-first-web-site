<p><strong>The bench press, or chest press<br><u> is a weight training exercise where a person presses a weight upwards while lying horizontally on a weight training bench.</u> Although the bench press is a compound movement, the muscles primarily used are the pectoralis major, the anterior deltoids, and the triceps, among other stabilizing muscles. A barbell is generally used to hold the weight, but a pair of dumbbells can also be used.</strong></p>
<p style="margin-top: 400px;"><strong>The barbell bench press is one of three lifts in the sport of powerlifting alongside the deadlift and the squat. These are the only lifts in the sport of Paralympic powerlifting.</strong> The bench press is also extensively used in weight training, bodybuilding, and other types of training to develop the chest muscles. Bench press strength is important in combat sports as it closely correlates to punching power. To improve upper body strength, power, and endurance for athletic, occupational, and functional performance as well as muscle development, the barbell bench press is frequently used.</p>
