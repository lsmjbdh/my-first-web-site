      <p>The "street" approach to style and fashion is often based on individualism,<strong> rather than focusing solely on current fashion trends.</strong> Using street style methods, individuals demonstrate their multiple, negotiated identities, in addition to utilizing subcultural and intersecting styles or trends. This, in itself, is a performance, as it creates a space where identities can be explored through the act(ion) of dress.</p>
      <p>Bill Cunningham for The New York Times pointed street style out as a keen catalogue of ordinary people's clothing. Also, <u>he mentioned that streets tell a great deal about fashion and people, if one listens.</u> According to him the best fashion show is coming to life every day on the streets.</p>
